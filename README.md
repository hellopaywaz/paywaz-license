# paywaz-license

A central repository containing the licensing terms for the Paywaz public projects.  
This repo holds the official license(s) under which Paywaz’s API, SDKs, documentation, samples, and other related repositories are distributed.

## What’s in this repo

- The definitive license file (e.g. `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md`) with full legal terms for using, distributing, and contributing to Paywaz code and documentation.  
- (Optional) Any supplementary license or license-term templates, if applicable (e.g. for special modules, third-party dependencies, addendums).  
- (Optional) Guidance notes or metadata about how license applies across Paywaz repositories.  

This single place ensures license consistency across all Paywaz-branded public repos: SDK, API, samples, docs, etc.

---

## Why this repo matters

- By centralizing the license, all Paywaz projects refer to one authoritative source — reducing the chance of license divergence or confusion.  
- Consumers, contributors, and integrators have a clear, unambiguous statement of rights and restrictions upfront.  
- Helps with compliance, audits, and clarity: everyone knows under what terms the code/documentation is licensed.  

As per GitHub best practices: having a clearly defined license improves the transparency and trustworthiness of your public repositories. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
